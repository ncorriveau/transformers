Next things to do: 
- create model training loop using the generalized model based off a config (can hard code for now but then we want it to be a yaml)
- create easy testing framework with the shakespeare.txt 
- run model to make sure it works to start 
- add in additional features (e.g. more weight tying, layer norms, RoPE, cross layer attention, etc )
- tests
- start working on different attention engines? 
- start building simple monitoring server
